# SelfDrivingRCCar

This repository was created for the 2019 MTSU hackathon. The goal is to create an autonomous RC car using an supervised end to end learning apporach with a convolutional neural network


An Android application was created (with the help of our lovey mentor: Jacob Rakidzich) to interface with a raspberry pi, sending data for wheel displacement and throttle: https://github.com/JZDesign/SelfDrivingRCCar
